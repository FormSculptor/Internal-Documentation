### Communication

- **RESTful APIs**:
  - **Usage**: Facilitates standard communication between the front-end and back-end services. RESTful APIs enable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing the front-end to interact seamlessly with services like Authentication, Document Management, and Analytics.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Stateless interactions simplify scalability.
    - Clear separation of concerns enhances maintainability.

- **GraphQL**:
  - **Usage**: Optimizes data querying by allowing clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues common with RESTful APIs.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Improved performance through efficient data retrieval.
    - Enhanced flexibility for front-end developers to define query structures.

### Scalability Considerations

- **Auto Scaling on AWS**:
  - **Implementation**: Utilizes AWS Auto Scaling groups to automatically adjust the number of running instances based on traffic and load metrics. This ensures the platform remains responsive during high-demand periods and cost-effective during low-usage times.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Maintains optimal performance without manual intervention.
    - Enhances reliability by distributing workloads across multiple instances.

- **Load Balancing**:
  - **Implementation**: Deploys AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple server instances. This prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck and ensures high availability.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Improves fault tolerance by rerouting traffic from failed instances.
    - Enhances user experience with consistent response times.

### Security Measures

- **Encryption**:
  - **Data at Rest**: Implements AES-256 encryption to protect stored data within databases and file storage systems, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure even if storage mediums are compromised.
  - **Data in Transit**: Utilizes TLS 1.2+ protocols to encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers, safeguarding against interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - **Implementation**: Employs Role-Based Access Control to define and enforce user permissions based on roles (e.g., Admin, User, Guest). This ensures that users can only access resources and perform actions that align with their designated roles, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Simplifies permission management.
    - Enhances security by adhering to the principle of least privilege.

- **Compliance (ISO/IEC 27001)**:
  - **Implementation**: Adheres to ISO/IEC 27001 standards for information security management, establishing a systematic approach to managing sensitive company and customer information.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Ensures alignment with international best practices.
    - Enhances trust with users and stakeholders by demonstrating commitment to security.
