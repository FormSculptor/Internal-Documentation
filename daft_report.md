### Project Background

In today's digital era, organizations in Hong Kong and globally face significant challenges in managing vast amounts of documents efficiently. According to the **Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC, 2022)**, businesses spend an average of **30% of their time** searching for documents, leading to productivity losses and increased operational costs. Furthermore, the **Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD, 2023)** reported a **25% increase** in data breaches related to document mishandling in Hong Kong over the past year. These statistics highlight the urgent need for effective document management solutions.

FormSculptor addresses these issues by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate and optimize document-centric processes. By promoting paperless operations and energy-efficient practices, the project aligns with sustainable development goals and Hong Kong's commitment to environmental conservation as outlined in the **Hong Kong Climate Action Plan 2050 (Environmental Bureau, 2021)**. The platform's user-centric design ensures accessibility for users with disabilities, adhering to international standards such as **WCAG 2.1**, and commits to ethical AI use, fostering trust and compliance.

  - **Data in Transit**: Utilizes TLS 1.2+ protocols to encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers, safeguarding against interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - **Implementation**: Employs Role-Based Access Control to define and enforce user permissions based on roles (e.g., Admin, User, Guest). This ensures that users can only access resources and perform actions that align with their designated roles, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Simplifies permission management.
    - Enhances security by adhering to the principle of least privilege.

- **Compliance (ISO/IEC 27001)**:
  - **Implementation**: Adheres to ISO/IEC 27001 standards for information security management, establishing a systematic approach to managing sensitive company and customer information.
