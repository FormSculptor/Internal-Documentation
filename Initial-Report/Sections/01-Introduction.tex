\section{Introduction}

In today's digital era, organizations in Hong Kong and globally face significant challenges in managing vast amounts of documents efficiently. According to the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC, 2022), businesses spend an average of 30\% of their time searching for documents, leading to productivity losses and increased operational costs. Furthermore, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD, 2023) reported a 25\% increase in data breaches related to document mishandling in Hong Kong over the past year. These statistics highlight the urgent need for effective document management solutions.
